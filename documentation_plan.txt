T4G FOR BUSINESS - SOURCE CODE DOCUMENTATION PLAN
====================================================

GENERAL OVERVIEW
================

Platform: T4G for Business - Web-based waste management platform
Tech Stack:
  - Frontend: Flutter Web (Dart 3.7.2)
  - Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
  - Server: Node.js/Express
  - UI Framework: Material Design + ShadcN UI

State Management: GetX (reactive state management with dependency injection)
Local Storage: Hive (for offline-first capabilities and caching)

Key Libraries:
  - fl_chart (data visualization)
  - pdf/printing (document generation)
  - http (API communication)

CI/CD & Deployment:
  - Hosting: Firebase Hosting + Heroku (Node.js/Express server)
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions (automated deployment on push to main)
  - Build: Flutter Web build with environment variable injection
  - Auto-routing: Single-page application with client-side routing
  - Deployment Process: Commit → Push → GitHub Actions auto-deploys

DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY
======================

1. ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENTATION (Week 1)
   - Document CustomGetView pattern with real examples
   - Explain Controller vs Presenter separation
   - Document dependency injection flow with GetX bindings
   - Create visual diagrams of layer interactions
   - Explain interface-implementation pattern usage

2. FEATURE DOCUMENTATION (Week 2-3)
   - Pick 1-2 complete features as reference examples
   - Document each layer (domain → data → presentation)
   - Show data flow from UI interaction to API call and back
   - Highlight common patterns (error handling, loading states, navigation)
   - Create step-by-step guide: "How to add a new feature"

3. CODE-LEVEL DOCUMENTATION (Ongoing)
   Priority order:
   a) Core services (auth, navigation, HTTP, Hive local storage)
   b) Shared utilities and helpers
   c) Complex business logic in controllers
   d) Reusable widgets and components
   e) Data models and transformations

4. COMMON PATTERNS GUIDE (Week 4)
   - State management patterns
   - Form validation patterns
   - API integration patterns
   - Local data persistence patterns (Hive)
   - Navigation patterns
   - Error handling patterns
   - Testing patterns

5. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
   - Common errors and solutions
   - Build and deployment issues
   - Testing setup problems
   - Firebase configuration
   - Hive initialization and TypeAdapter issues

DOCUMENTATION FORMAT
====================

1. README.md Updates
   - Keep high-level architecture overview
   - Link to detailed documentation

2. In-Code Documentation
   - Add dartdoc comments (///) to public APIs
   - Focus on WHY, not WHAT
   - Include usage examples in complex classes
   - Document non-obvious behaviors

3. Separate Markdown Docs (docs/ folder)
   - architecture.md - Detailed architecture explanation
   - feature-guide.md - Step-by-step feature development
   - patterns.md - Common code patterns with examples
   - api-integration.md - HTTP service and API patterns
   - data-persistence.md - Hive local storage setup and patterns
   - testing.md - Testing strategies and examples

4. Visual Aids
   - Architecture diagrams (use mermaid.js in markdown)
   - Data flow diagrams
   - File structure trees

DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
=======================

For Classes:
```dart
/// Brief description of what this class does.
///
/// Detailed explanation of its role in the architecture.
/// Mention which layer it belongs to.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final controller = MyController();
/// controller.doSomething();
/// ```
class MyClass { }
```

For Methods:
```dart
/// Brief description of what method does.
///
/// [param1] - Description of parameter
/// Returns: Description of return value
/// Throws: Exceptions that can be thrown
Future<Result> myMethod(String param1) { }
```

For Complex Logic:
- Add inline comments explaining business rules
- Reference domain requirements when applicable
- Explain non-obvious decisions

For Hive Models & TypeAdapters:
```dart
/// Model for storing user preferences locally using Hive.
///
/// TypeAdapter ID: 0 (must be unique across all Hive models)
/// Box name: 'userPreferences'
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final box = await Hive.openBox<UserPreferences>('userPreferences');
/// await box.put('current', UserPreferences(theme: 'dark'));
/// ```
@HiveType(typeId: 0)
class UserPreferences { }
```

RECOMMENDED TOOLS
=================

- dartdoc: Generate API documentation
- Mermaid.js: Create diagrams in markdown
- VS Code: Use "Document This" extensions
- draw.io: For complex architecture diagrams

DOCUMENTATION CHECKLIST
=======================

High Priority:
□ CustomGetView pattern explained
□ Feature development step-by-step guide
□ Core services documented (AuthService, HttpService, NavigationService, Hive LocalStorage)
□ Data persistence patterns (Hive setup, TypeAdapters, CRUD operations)
□ Common patterns guide created
□ One complete feature documented as reference

Medium Priority:
□ All public interfaces documented
□ Repository pattern explained
□ UseCase pattern explained
□ Widget composition patterns
□ Testing setup and examples

Low Priority:
□ All private methods documented
□ Utility functions documented
□ Legacy code notes
□ Performance optimization notes

MAINTENANCE
===========

- Update docs when patterns change
- Add new patterns to patterns.md as they emerge
- Keep examples up-to-date with latest Flutter/GetX versions
- Review docs quarterly for accuracy

METRICS FOR SUCCESS
===================

- Junior developer can create new feature independently
- Code review comments focus on logic, not structure
- New team members productive within 2 weeks
- Reduced "how do I..." questions in team chats
